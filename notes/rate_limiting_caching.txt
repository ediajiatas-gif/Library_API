Flask limiter - protects APIs from abuse (excessive traffic or DDOS attacks - when computers flood website or server with a lot of fake traffic, site stops working)

Flask caching - enhance performance to reduce repetitive db queries and improving response times

                            What is Flask Limiter?
Extension that provides rate limiting for Flask apps
- prevents abuse of APIs by limiting number of requests
- protects our API from malicious attacks like DDOS attacks (repetitive requests to overwhelm your server)
- allows us to set limits per route or globally

INSTALLING:
pip install Flask-Limiter

                                    How To Use
Rate limit syntax: "5 per minute" or "100 per hour"


                            What is Flask Caching?
Extension to cache data and improve performance in Flask app by storing the results of expensive (frequently accessed) API calls 
- Caching: storing frequently accessed data to a cache so you can reach into cache instead of a full db query
= Increases speed at which data is returned and prevents repetitive calls to db
- we only really use it 'GET' information
