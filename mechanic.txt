Design an ERD for a small mechanic shop that includes entities like customers, service_tickets, and mechanics.

Think about the information that should be stored in each table.
When you last went to a mechanic what information did they collect from you?
What do you think is important information to document about a service? Maybe a description? You'd probably need the cars VIN?
For mechanics maybe keep this one simple. For most companies there is a variety of information stored about each employee, for this simple project lets keep the employee info basic: name, email, address, phone, salary etc.

Lastly, think about the relationships these entities have.
As a customer how many times can I bring my car to the shop?
How many customers should a single service be attributed to?
Could a single service require multiple mechanics?
As a mechanic would I be responsible for multiple services throughout the day?

Entities:
customers: id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, address
service_tickets: id, customer_id, service_desc, price, VIN
mechanics: id, first_name, last_name, password, email, salary, address

Relationships:
customer -> service_tickets: 1:M One customer can receive many services, once service_ticket will link back to a single customer
service_tickets -> mechanics: M:M 1 ticket could require many mechanics, 1 mechanic can work on many tickets
